## Using Git
### Creating a repository and adding it to Github
After going on to GitHub and creating a new repository by hitting the "+" symbol in the upper right corner:
1) To create the README file (which you can modify later): `echo "# [your_project_name]" >> README.md`
2) Initialize your folder as a git repository (aka to be tracked with git): `git init`
3) `git add -A`
4) `git commit -m "first commit"`
5) `git branch -M main`
6) `git remote add origin [link to your repository on github]`
7) `git push -u origin main`

### Updating your repository following its creation
{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" context="info" text="If you are working in a repo that has multiple users, your first command before should be <code>git pull</code> so that the repository on your computer receives any changes made by other users!" />}}  
1) `git add -A`
2) `git commit -m "A message about what you are adding to the repository with this update"`
3) `git push -u origin main` (*note*: you can also simply type `git push`, but specifiying the origin is helpful if there is more than one person working in your repository).

## Publishing a Static Site
Once you have Markdown files on GitHub, creating static pages is simple! Go to the "Settings" tab of you repository on GitHub, then select "Pages" from the menu: 
<img src="/images/setting.png" title="select 'pages' from settings menu to left of page" alt="alt title" width="100%"/>

In these GitHub Pages settings, change the source from "None" to your "main" branch and hit save to publish your site! 

<img src="/images/branch.png" title="change branch from 'none' to master branch" alt="alt title" width="100%"/>

{{< alert icon=":mega:" context="warning" text="<b>Note:</b> It can take up to 10 minutes for your site to publish!" />}}  

This workshop covers how to publish a single page static site, but if you would like to challenge yourself and use what you learned in this workshop today to go further, here are some resources about creating a complete static site (like this very site you're on right now!) using a static site generator:
