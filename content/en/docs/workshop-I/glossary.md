## Part I: Command line environment

**Command line**
- The command line is a blank line and cursor on the screen, allowing the user to type in instructions for the computer to execute.
**Command line interface**
- A command line interface is a text-based user interface for a computer. 
**Miniconda**
- Miniconda is a command line environment; this is something which allows you to install programming related tools in their own “bubble” on your computer so that they can easily be managed/removed.
**Directory**
- Same thing as a folder!
- A location/space for storing files on your computer.
- An example of a location/space is your device’s “Desktop”.


## Part II: Text editor

**Markup language**
- A markup language is a text encoding system used to structure, format, index, and link text files, resulting in a text that is easy for your computer to process and read..
- The most popular example of a markup language is HTML.
**Markdown**
- A markup language with simple syntax (grammar) that formats text (e.g., creates headers, paragraphs, bold font, italics)
- GitHub uses Markdown for text, as does Jupyter Notebook.
**Text editor**
- A program which allows a user to edit the contents of a text file.
**Code Editor**
- A text editor with advanced functionality to help with the writing of code.
- Text editor and code editor are often used interchangeably! Historically, there were only text editors.
**Visual Studio Code**
- A code editor used for writing and editing code as well as taking notes in Markdown.

## Part III: Git and GitHub

**Git**
- Git is an open access “version control system” that allows you to track and control (i.e. manage) your computing projects.
- As a version control system, it allows you to return to a previous version of your code should something go wrong.
**Git repository**
- Git’s virtual storage space for a project. 
- When you use Git to manage your project folder, that folder becomes a repository
- Repositories are often referred to as a “repo”.
**GitHub**
- GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories.
**Local**
- This term refers to something only on your personal device, such as a file that has yet to be added to a GitHub repository.
**Remote**
- Remote repositories are versions of a project that are hosted off your computer, on the internet or another external network somewhere.
**Personal access token**
- A personal access token (PAT) is an alternative to using passwords for authentication to GitHub. Personal access tokens enable individuals to access their GitHub resources via the command line. 
**Elements of a Git repository**
- README.md
  - A file that contains the documentation for a project. 
- Folder (project) content
- Commits
  - A “commit” is the note you will see to the right of the file listings in your GitHub repository. They capture a snapshot of a project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to. 
- Branch
  - In a Git repository, a branch is a place where the changes to your code are stored and recorded.
  - You will always have a primary branch formed when you create a Git repository. In projects where multiple people are working on different elements of the code, there will be multiple branches for each element.
