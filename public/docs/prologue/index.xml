      <description>Digital humanities can be defined as a scholarly community of practice in which humanists use computational methodologies to solve a range of research problems.
Typically, humanists are scholars in fields such as history, literary studies, religious studies, music, archaeology, philosophy, and linguistics.
They are trained in the qualitative research methods of these humanistic disciplines and then adopt computational methods that require an expertise in computer programming.
This suite of workshops is designed to introduce humanists to computational methods.</description>
